# gqlr = GraphQL + R: a data query language and runtime

Since 2012, Facebook has developed [GraphQL](http://graphql.org): a backend agnostic data query language and runtime.  GraphQL drastically reduces the number of server requests created by the browser by using a dynamic and nested query structure.  Using the [Working Draft Specification for GraphQL](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/), [`gqlr`](https://github.com/schloerke/gqlr) implements a full GraphQL server within R.  [`gqlr`](https://github.com/schloerke/gqlr) allows users to supply their own R functions to satisfy the data requirements of a GraphQL query generated by the browser.
