GraphQL: An R server implementation

Since 2012, Facebook has developed GraphQL: a backend agnostic data query language and runtime.  GraphQL drastically reduces the number of server requests created by the browser by using a dynamic and nested query structure.  Using the Working Draft Specification for GraphQL, graphqlr implements a full GraphQL server within R.  graphqlr allows users to supply their own R functions to satisfy the data requirements of a GraphQL query generated by the browser.
